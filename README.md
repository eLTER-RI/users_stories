# TASK 1: Collection of users stories

This repository contains eLTER user stories, inspired by and forked from the [i-adopt repo](https://github.com/i-adopt/users_stories).
This README will be updated further as this system is tested for eLTER WP10/11.
It is used to collate and discuss users stories submitted to the group.
A user story is a short and simple description of what a particular type of user wants a solution to achieve, and why they want that.
We are expanding the concept to include more complete narratives that can more fully explain your one-sentence user story.


## Instructions

To initiate a user story, [Get Started](https://github.com/eLTER_RI/users_stories/issues/new?assignees=&labels=user+story&template=user-story-submission-template.md&title=Role+-+Desired+Action+-+Benefit).
(If there is some problem, go to the Issues tab for the repository, click <kbd>New issue</kbd>, then click on <kbd>Get Started</kbd> using the "User story submission template".)

If you just want to create a regular ticket that isn't a user story, then [Open a blank issue](https://github.com/eLTER-RI/users_stories/issues/new).

### Filling out the name

The ideal name is quite short, unique, and makes it easy to find your user story.

If you can replace the each component of the suggested title (Role, Desired Action, and Benefit) with one or two words
to uniquely define your story, that's recommended.
If not, make the title whatever you think will help you and others find it.

### Filling out the template

There are five sections.
In the first three sections, replace the one-line description with a single phrase to complete that part.
Remember that the user story is read by putting the first three sections together, so short phrases are most helpful.

The fourth section helps us categorize the user story, and can be a few keywords reflecting the research domain to which your user story applies.
(Feel free to provide IRIs from controlled vocabularies here.
:-) )

Look at some of the other user stories for inspiration, and remember that you have a section at the end into which you can add
all the details that help define your complete user story.

### Submission and Editing

Be sure to submit your user story using the <kbd>Submit new issue</kbd> button at the very bottom of the page.

You can go back and edit your story at any time by visiting it (while logged in to GitHub), clicking on the <kbd>...</kbd> icon at the upper right of your story and selecting <kbd>Edit</kbd> from the context menu.
After you are finished, make sure to hit the <kbd>Update comment</kbd> button to save your changes.

If you save an incomplete story, put (Incomplete) in the title so readers know you are still working on it.
