# TASK 1: Collection of users stories

This repository relates to Task 1 of the I-ADOPT workplan. It is used to collate and discuss users stories submitted to the group.

## Instructions

To create a user story, go to the Issues tab for the repository, click New issue, then click on Get Started for the "User story submission template"; or, simply visit https://github.com/i-adopt/users_stories/issues/new?assignees=&labels=user+story&template=user-story-submission-template.md&title=Role+-+Desired+Action+-+Benefit.
